A lightweight web application for easy viewing of relevant NHL player data and DFS data.

### What makes this web app special?
- Lightweight compared to many other data sites. Using this app gives you an extremely fast viewing experience of the relevant data you need.
- Customizable table views of data
    - Pick which stats you want to display, so you don't have to keep scrolling where you can't fit the desired columns in one screen.
- Daily fantasy sports salary data is included in the player stats. If a team is on the day's slate, its player's DFS salaries will be included in the display.
